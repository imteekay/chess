# Ideas

1. Develop all your pieces before trying to attack (unless there's a tactic that will immediately win material).
2. Keep your pieces protected. Unsafe pieces become targets. Every move should aim to make progress whilst keeping your pieces safe.
3. Always check for threats, particularly with the opponent's queen. Your eyes should be trained for B+Q and N+Q checkmates.
4. Don't trade active pieces for inactive pieces, and do trade inactive pieces for active pieces.
5. Keep training tactics through puzzles. Puzzles are the way chess players maintain and improve their vision.
